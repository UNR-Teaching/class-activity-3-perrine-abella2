Tic-Tac-Toe Refactor Exercise

### Problem 1
Refactor and expand your TicTacToe to use multiple classes.\
Make sure they are unit tested.

### Problem 2
Create integration tests, according to your test plan\
Include a brief description of your test plan as a text document

In our tic tac toe game, we have three disctinct components (classes):
Board, Player, and Game. During our integration testing, we used the top
down method to test interaction between board and game; and board, game, and player. 
We have more tests we want to add to include more user input and game win conditions.
